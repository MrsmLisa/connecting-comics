Connecting Comics is a non-profit association dedicated to supporting comic artists of all levels. Their mission is to build an open, welcoming community where creators can learn, share knowledge, and grow together.
They organize workshops, drawing sessions, and talks focused on comics — from storytelling and art fundamentals to publishing and career skills. Their events are designed to be accessible, practical, and inspiring.

The live website can be found here: Connecting Comics 

## 1. User experience
The website is made for Connecting Comics. Their goal is to become more visible to the comic community, get more members and have more people come to their workshops.

The site provides information about Connecting Comics and the different events they host. There is a form to become a member.

The target audiens for the site are comic artists that want to meet others with the same interests and take part in comic related events.

**User stories**

As a First-Time Visitor, I want to be able to find information quickly and without problem. I want user-friendly design that works on different devises.
I want high quality images and engaging illustrations.
I want to easily find the information on what the workshops entail and an easy way to sign up.
As a potential member I want an easy-to-use membership form. 

## 2. Design

**Colour scheme**

**Typography**
I have used font from google font for the site.
Luckiest guy is used for page title, headers throughout the page and for the name of the company in the navbar.

Quicksand is used for the rest of the text.

<img width="457" height="128" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/66729bef-8935-4ef8-9fce-dd5eb689b0a8" />

I have used Font Awesome for the social media icons in the contact form. 

**Imagery**

The images used on the page are from the AI image generating sites Image Generator and Freepik. The comic bubbles in the header is from Freepik.

## 3. Features

The website consists of three pages, one page for the membership form and one for the success page (five pages in total). The first page contains a short description of the association and links for the different events. The second page contains the workshops that the association offers. The third contains their event Drink and Draw. 

### 3.1 General features
### 3.1.1 All pages

**Navigation**
All the pages contain a responsive navigation bar. The nav bar is is from Bootstrap as I wanted a fully collapsable bar with a toggler. The toggler with the burger icon appears in viewpoints 768px or smaller. I changed the font for the associations name to match the rest of the headers. The associations name navigates back to the home-page. The other links lead to their pages except for the contact link that takes you down to the bottom of the form. The navbar is fixed at the top so it is easily accessible.

![navbar-2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8c89963a-6df0-498c-868d-8aaac4d7c02f)


**Footer**
I have split the footer into two sections. The first being a contact info with the associatons adress, phone number and the Font Awsome icons that links to their social media. The second is a contact us form with name, email and message. At the viewport 320px the contact us part goes below the contact info.

### 3.1.2. Index page

The index page contains a hero section with the name and some comic bubbles in the background. The hero exists an all pages but with different text and color to mark the different parts of the website. The index, membership sign up and success pages are pink, the workshop page is blue and the Drink and Draw is green.

The page starts with a short introductory text on the association and pictures to show the main purpose of the website. This allows the user to immediately understand what the purpose of the association. 

![index-1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2ebddfa3-7947-404c-82fd-3de20f4fb613)


There is text, photos and boxes on the page that are all responsive to different devices. The color of the boxes represent the color of the two pages so it is easy to see what belongs where. The buttons are in black to make them stand out more.

### 3.2. Future implementations

In future implementations I would put in testimonials of members that have already taken part in the workshop and Drink & Draw.

I would put in an about page that shows everything that the association stands for and what their future plans are.

I would also have liked to put in a section for an interactive map to show the location of the association.

### 3.3. Accessibility

While designing the website I have had the aim to make it as accessible and user friendly as possible. To achieve this I have used:

  - Semantic HTML - for this I have used the contrast checker to make sure all my text is visible.
  - I have also used the [Web Disability Simulator](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/web-disability-simulator/olioanlbgbpmdlgjnnampnnlohigkjla) to make sure the visuals on the page has enough contrast.
  - Aria-labels
